# gif2apng
example for setting up a brew install for a lib I like.

Version 1.7 has been out since 2015 so I assume this library isn't going to be updated again anytime soon. 

Just gonna save some pebble devs some time so that they can do `brew install gif2apng`. 

## Installation

`brew tap davidawad/gif2apng`

`brew install gif2apng`
