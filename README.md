# gif2apng
Example for setting up a brew install for a library I like. I DID NOT WRITE THIS REPO. It's distributed through Sourceforge and you can find the link below. 

Version 1.7 has been out since 2015 so I assume this library isn't going to be updated again anytime soon, but I'll keep it up to date through here if anything happens.  

Just gonna save some pebble devs some time so that they can do `brew install gif2apng`. 

## Installation
```
brew tap davidawad/gif2apng

brew install gif2apng
```
